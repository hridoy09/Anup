                Water is one of the earth’s most precious and threatened resources. Like the rest of the third world country, Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated country, is facing severe water pollution and scarcity. Although 97% of the total population has access to water, the quality of water is always questionable (WHO, 2018). 8.5% of the total death in Bangladesh is caused by water, sanitation and hygiene-related issues (UN-Water, 2013).
