        Welcome to <span style="font-weight: bold;">BLUE AQUA</span>’s website, where we invite you to learn about who we are, how we serve our broad base of constituents and what we stand for.
        <br>

We have been at the forefront of developing, marketing and distributing safe, innovative and cost-effective pure drinking water. The pure drinking water we produce is strictly quality controlled by experienced chemists and microbiologists in our laboratory at the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BLUE AQUA</span> drinking water factory, which is tested by BUET and ICDDR,B. It is marketed under the authorization of Bangladesh Standards & Testing Institution (BSTI).
<br>
We have delivered long-term, profitable returns to our investors, value to our partners and rewarding careers to our employees.
<br>
Our proven track record with both current and pipeline products, industry experience, sales and marketing expertise, and tireless commitment to quality stand as indelible trademarks for all that we do as a company.
<br>
The individual strengths that thrive in our two dynamic divisions – leadership integrity and an agile organizational structure – coupled with a cumulative commitment to quality and service, have created a “one company, one goal” perspective that guides and empowers us unlike any other team in the industry.
<br>
Looking ahead we are determined to achieve our goal of becoming a force in affordable pure hydrate solution. And to do this we will continue to capitalize and build on the unique fundamentals of our group values, people and products by encouraging innovation, entrepreneurship and growth.
